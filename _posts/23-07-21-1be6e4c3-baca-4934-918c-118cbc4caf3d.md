<div dir=3D"ltr">A strange loop is a cyclic structure that goes through sev=
eral levels in a hierarchical system. It arises when, by moving only upward=
s or downwards through the system, one finds oneself back where one started=
. Strange loops may involve self-reference and paradox. The concept of a st=
range loop was proposed and extensively discussed by Douglas Hofstadter in =
G=C3=B6del, Escher, Bach, and is further elaborated in Hofstadter&#39;s boo=
k I Am a Strange Loop, published in 2007. </div>
